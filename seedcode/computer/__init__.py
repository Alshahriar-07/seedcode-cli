"""Computer Engine: safe, permissioned control of the local desktop.

The engine gives agent mode "hands and eyes" on the machine: mouse, keyboard,
screenshots, window management, application launch/close, and the registry.
Everything is Windows-only in this release and every dependency is optional
(``pip install seedcode-cli[desktop]``) — the rest of Seed Code must import
this package safely on any platform, so all heavy imports happen lazily and
:func:`is_available` is the single gate callers consult first.

Layout mirrors the tool engine philosophy: small driver modules
(:mod:`mouse`, :mod:`keyboard`, :mod:`screen`, :mod:`windows`, :mod:`vision`,
:mod:`registry`) wrap the libraries, :mod:`permissions` owns the Desktop
Control grant flow, and :class:`~seedcode.computer.controller.ComputerController`
is the façade the tools talk to.
