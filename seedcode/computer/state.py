"""Computer Engine execution state.

The engine keeps its own memory of the machine so the AI never has to re-ask
for it: what app is focused, where the pointer is, what's on the clipboard,
which directory the terminal is in, and a short trail of the last actions. The
:class:`StateManager` refreshes the live parts (focused window, pointer) on
demand from the drivers and records the rest as the dispatcher executes skills.

This module is deterministic and offline — it only reads driver state and holds
values; it never talks to an AI provider.
