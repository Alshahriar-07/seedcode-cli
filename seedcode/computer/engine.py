"""Computer Engine facade: the stable, offline, AI-independent entry point.

This is the single object the rest of Seed Code talks to. It owns and wires the
deterministic subsystems — controller (drivers), element resolver, state
manager, verification engine, recovery engine and the skill dispatcher — and
exposes a small, stable API:

* :meth:`run_skill`  — run a named skill (or ``ui_*`` semantic verb) end-to-end
  with verification and recovery; returns a :class:`DispatchResult`.
* :meth:`state`      — the current :class:`ComputerState` (engine memory).
* :meth:`see`        — a semantic snapshot for the AI to replan against.
* :meth:`catalog`    — the skill manifest text for the AI, filtered by level.

The engine contains no provider/AI code and works offline. It is created once
per session (lazily) and holds no per-request state beyond the shared
StateManager.
